🛠 Next Steps Breakdown
✅ Step 1: API Gateway Setup (Optional but Recommended)
Since you're building a microservices-based e-commerce system, an API Gateway can centralize authentication, routing, and security.

What to Do?

Choose Express.js or Fastify (lightweight) as the Gateway.
Implement reverse proxy logic (e.g., http-proxy-middleware).
Use Rate Limiting, Logging, and Security Headers at the gateway level.
Pass only authorized requests to microservices.
Why?

Keeps internal services secure and hidden.
Avoids exposing multiple service endpoints.
✅ Step 2: User Management Service (Basic Profile & Roles)
Now, expand the User Service (beyond authentication) to manage profiles, roles, and permissions.

📌 Features
User Profile Management
Update user details: Name, Phone, Address, Avatar
View other users (Admin feature)
Role & Permission Management
Assign User Roles: (CUSTOMER, VENDOR, ADMIN)
Restrict API access based on roles.
APIs to Implement
GET /api/users/profile → Get User Profile
PUT /api/users/profile → Update Profile
GET /api/users → Admin: Get All Users
PATCH /api/users/{id}/role → Admin: Update Role
Tech Choices
✅ Service: Node.js (TypeScript)
✅ Database: PostgreSQL (Using Prisma)
✅ Authentication: JWT + Role-based Middleware

✅ Step 3: Product Microservice
Start building the Product Service, which allows vendors to add/manage products and customers to browse.

📌 Features
Vendors
Add, update, and delete products.
Customers
Browse products by category, price, rating.
View detailed product descriptions.
APIs to Implement
POST /api/products → Add New Product (Vendor only)
GET /api/products → List All Products
GET /api/products/{id} → Get Product Details
PUT /api/products/{id} → Update Product (Vendor only)
DELETE /api/products/{id} → Delete Product (Vendor only)
Tech Choices
✅ Service: Node.js (TypeScript)
✅ Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma
✅ Authorization: Vendors can modify their own products only.

✅ Step 4: Orders & Payments
Once Users & Products are in place, add the Order & Payment Service.

📌 Features
Customers
Place orders, track orders, cancel orders.
Vendors
Fulfill orders, view pending orders.
Payments
Integrate Razorpay or Stripe for secure payments.
APIs to Implement
POST /api/orders → Create a new order
GET /api/orders → View order history
GET /api/orders/{id} → Order details
PATCH /api/orders/{id}/status → Update order status
POST /api/payments → Payment processing
Tech Choices
✅ Service: Node.js (TypeScript)
✅ Database: PostgreSQL
✅ Payment Gateway: Stripe / Razorpay

🚀 Step 5: Frontend Integration
After the backend microservices are stable, build the frontend (React + Material UI) to:

Register/Login Users
Browse Products
Add to Cart
Place Orders
Track Order Status
